# Soft-Sensor-Design-for-Sulfur-Recovery-Unit
Machine learning–based soft sensor for a Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) to predict H₂S and SO₂ tail-gas concentrations. Compared regression and deep learning models, identifying nonlinear SRU dynamics. AR-DeepNN achieved high accuracy (R² ≈ 0.96  for out1 and 0.94 for out2), enabling real-time process monitoring and emission reduction.
